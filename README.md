# Style private browsing

## What it does

Get it here: [Style Private Browsing](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/style-private-browsing/) from addons.mozilla.org. Requires Firefox 59.

Adds a dark and light style to private browsing windows to better distinguish them from normal windows. Builds on the [Mozilla webextensions-examples code](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) for both dynamic themes and options pages.
